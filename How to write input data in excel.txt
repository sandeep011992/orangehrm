< we need to import file input stream and
 
	 file output stream

	< Related to Apache.poi we need to import 

	 XSSF workbook ,XSSF sheet,XSSF row,XSSF cell,
		
	<these are the class files we need to Import

	< Coming to file input Stream


		fis = new FileInputStream(xlFilePath);

        	workbook = new XSSFWorkbook(fis);

        	sheet = workbook.getSheet(sheetName);

        	row = sheet.getRow(rowNum);

        	cell = row.getCell(column);

		String str6=cell.getStringCellValue();

	<like that we can select cell value

	< and we can write that cell value at particular row 

	 and column

	< if you want to save that file we need to write

		F(out)=new FileOutStream(xlFilePath)

		workbook.write(F(out)

	<and we have to close

		F(out).flush();
		
		F(out).Close();
		
		workbook.close();
		
		Fis.close();
