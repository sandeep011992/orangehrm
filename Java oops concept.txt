1. How to Initilise object value

	< we can initilise the object value by using Constructor in java.

	There are two types of Constructors Available

	1.Default Constructor.

	2.Parameterized Constructor.

    1.Default Constructor:-


		< In this constructor we will not assign any values

		< only default values will be assigned---String=Null,Int_0

    2.Parameterized Constructor:-

		< constructor which contain input parameter values

		< By using "this" keyword we can assaign the values.

		< & we can initilise object Values.

2.Explain about oops concept in java

	< The main oops concepts i ava is

	1.Abstraction

	2.Encapsulation

	3.Polymorphysm
	
	4.inheretance


1.Abstraction:-  

	> Hiding Background Details of particular object is known as Abstraction.
	
	> Abstraction is a process of hiding implementation Details from the user.

	> Only functionality will be provided to user.

  Abstraction can be achived in two ways in Java

	1.Abstract Class

	2.Interface.


	1.Abstract Class

		> In an Abstract class which contains abstract method those can be
		 
		  implmented in sub Class

		> If it is an Abtract class we can achieve only partial abstraction.

		> in Abstract class some part of implementation we can do in same class.

		> Like that we can achieve partial Abstraction by using Abstract Class.


	2.Interface:-

		> we can Achieve 100% Abstraction by using Interface

		> Because all methods will be fully implemented in the subclass by using 
		
		  implements keyword.

		> Like that we can Achieve Abstraction in Java.

	
        -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	


2.Encapsulation:-

		< if a class contains some private data member

		< we can generate setters and getters

		< and we can initilise the object value Securely.this process is known as Encapsulaton.


       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	

3. Polymorpism:-

		< Same method we can write in multiple ways in a same class is known as polymoroism

		< there are two types of polymorphysm

	1.Compile time Polymorphysm/Method overloading/static binding.

	2. run time Polymorphysm/Method overriding/dynamic Binding.




 1.Method over Loading:-

		< We can write same method name multiple times with different input arguments with in

		  a same class is known as method over loading.

		

 2.Method overriding:-



		< a same method is present in Parent class and child class and child class object which

		  is iver riding the parent class method during run time this concept is kown as
		
		  Method overriding.

3. Where you used this method overloading concept in your projects.


	> Whenever you creating Search nationalities, Search Employee, Search jobs. there might be a 

	  you have to write a same method multiple times with different input arguments.

	> you might have a search functionalaty on the search center Application.
	
	> you have to write different input arguments.

	> so based on the criteria you have to call appropriate method.

	> in ths situation we can use method overloading concept.

	> Search coustomer i.e.,

			coustomer ID,coustomer name,coustomer Location,coustomer country e.t.c.,			
	

	>That method contains four input Arguments

	> I want to know based on coustomer city who are the list of coustmersare Available.

	> so I have to develop a method name with different input arguments.

	> I want to find out exact coustomer then i want to write coustomer Name as well.

	>So that Corresponding set of drier instruction can be executed from the method & your program

	 will be executed.
